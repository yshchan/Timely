Timely
======

All the code I spent on my task manager, Timely. 

This repo will contain any code I come up with, when building the final version of the task manager. I hope other people can benefit from this.

Unless specified otherwise, all source code is released under the “North Star License” which simply means in order to use any of the code in your project you must give credit and a link back to the author (me) in some way or another on both your product web page and within the application’s about box or in-app legal agreement. In the case where source code from a published app is used, the resulting product’s app name must bear no similarities to my product name (Timely). If you submit your app to the Apple app store, you are required to send me a download link to your app on the app store, along with a promotional code if the app is not free. The source code is not yours and cannot be redistributed as your own. Doing so is theft.
